          <li><a href="https://github.com/liuzyon/acse-9-Forecasting_induced_seismicity_in_Oklahoma">Forecasting Induced Seismicity in Oklahoma</a>: Several unique and rich datasets of candidate factors from regions in Oklahoma are used to statistically evaluate and retrospectively forecast possible signatures of human-induced seismicity from existing high-quality earthquake in these regions. These datasets contain geological formation, injections, hydraulic fracturing activities and wells, each of which have millions of items. 
          This project originally designed and implemented a feedforward neural network model for induced seismicity forecasting, which eﬀectively improves the performance of model ﬁtting and prediction compared with logistic regression model also common-used in previous studies. The superiority of our neural network model was proven and their results about major factors to seismicity by two models were compared.</li>
